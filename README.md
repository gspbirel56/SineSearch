**SineSearch**

This name might not be appropriate, but the algorithm seemed to visualize as something like a sine wave in my mind.

I know this isn't as efficient as something as a hash map either, but it may have its uses. Who knows. This is something I visualized while I was in one of my classes, so I'm going to attempt it in Python. I didn't know much Python before starting this project.
